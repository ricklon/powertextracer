#Power Racing Text Racer

Adventures in text based driving. The ultimate driverless car game.
Create your:
* Driver (AI or Manual)
* Car
* Track
* Scavenger Hunt

It's a race and a scavenger hunt.

##Goals

This is a learning game for C/C++ development. Since it's a game.
We want it to be fun. So the game should be silly and competitive.
Inspiration is from Mad Mad Mad World films. Also, things like canonball run.
Additionally, the Power Racing Series where people create electric vehicles 
from recycled kids cars. 

Learn about object oriented programming by emulating or simulating real world 
objects and behaviors.

Additionally, this is can be done as a group project. Everyone get's to create
a car, track, and scavenger hunt. Also, create drivers that are AI or manual. 

Students are developers for this project.

# Developer values and parts
* Fork your own Github repository
* Set up Gitter chat to communicate  all the developers on the project.
* The reference code editing environment Cloud9ide or RaspberryPI
